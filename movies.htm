    Black Panther is my favorite movie that I have seen because of the amazing story and characters in the movie. I donâ€™t watch Marvel movies that often, but I really liked the plot of this story because of the many great messages the movie tells its viewers. One of these important messages is how although young people can provide new perspectives and innovation, elders can give wisdom and stability. My favorite scene from this movie is when Black Panther is in the ancestral planes the second time and confronts his father about how abandoning his cousin when he was a boy was wrong. I liked this scene because it is not often that you see the hero of the film actually agreeing with the villain of the film even though the villain is a monster.
