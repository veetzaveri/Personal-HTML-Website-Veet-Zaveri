                After graduating from DePaul with an undergraduate degree, I hope to pursue my master's degree in computer science. I hope to work in a technology-related role since that is where my main interests lie, and that is what I believe I can excel in. Although I may not get a technology-related offer immediately upon graduating, I hope to reach that sort of position within 2 years. Although I dream of taking over my family business, I realize that circumstances may be different at that time and I may change my mind to continue working for another company which is another reason why I am pursuing my master's degree immediately after graduating from DePaul. Therefore, I want to keep an open mind about my possibilities of my future career. By keeping an open mind, I can see other opportunities and think about my future more clearly rather than being stuck onto a specific road map for my career.

                In my free time I have several hobbies that I enjoy doing both with my friends and without friends. When it comes to spending time with others, I enjoy spending time with both my friends and family. With my friends, we like to go fishing during the summer by the Lakefront in Chicago. With my family, I enjoy simply having dinner with them and chatting. Another interest of mine is watching YouTube videos in my free time since that is my source of entertainment. I like to watch a wide variety of videos from video gaming to watching videos about business or the news. Another hobby of mine is playing video games, I usually play games on my PS4 console. I enjoy playing video games online with my friends since it helps take my mind off work or school and simply take a break. Another outdoor hobby that I enjoy with my friends is skiing which I at least try to go several times a year during the winter whenever I have free time. I enjoy the thrill of having to balance on skis zooming down a large hill.
