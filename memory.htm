                A favorite memory I had was when I got to visit Rajasthan, India during a summer vacation two years ago. This was a favorite memory of mine because of all the different sightseeing I got to do and the fun animal rides. In Rajasthan, it was exciting to ride a camel in the desert and also ride an elephant. When it came to sightseeing, I got to see historic sites such as Amber Palace and Jantar Mantar. Jantar Mantar is a collection of astronomical instruments from the 1700s, and has the worldâ€™s largest stone sundial. The Amber Palace is a fort that had many different rulers over the course of hundreds of years, and is one of the most popular sites for tourists in Rajasthan.
